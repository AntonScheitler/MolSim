variations

format of velocity-density-profile:
- number of particles, avgDensity, avgVelocity[3]

var1: higher gravity
- gravity = -8 (before -0.8)
- expected result: higher velocities

var2: higher particle mass
- only fluid particles have m=3 (before m=1)
- expected result: ?

var3: higher epsilon
- eps = 3 (before eps=1)
- expected result: higher attraction between the fluid particles

var4: higher sigma
- sigma=3 (before sigma=1)
(sigma: distance at wich potential between 2 particles is zero)
expected result: more (bigger) forces are acting on particles (effect: ?)
