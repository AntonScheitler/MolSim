variations

format of velocity-density-profile:
- number of particles, avgDensity, avgVelocity[3]

var1: higher gravity
- gravity = -8 (before -0.8)
- expected result: higher velocities
[USEFUL RESULT]5

var2: higher particle mass
- only fluid particles have m=3 (before m=1)
- expected result: ?

var3: higher epsilon
- eps = 3 (before eps=1)
- expected result: higher attraction between the fluid particles

deleted        var4: higher sigma
        - sigma=3 (before sigma=1)
        (sigma: distance at which potential between 2 particles is zero)
        expected result: more (bigger) forces are acting on particles (effect: ?)

var5: fixed sphere in the tube
- expected result: turbulences
[USEFUL RESULT]

var6: higher density of the fluid (smaller meshwidth h)
- h = 1 (before h=1.2)
- expected result: higher density
[USEFUL RESULT]

var7: smaller distance to the walls (tube narrower)
- expected result: ?

var8: no walls, but reflecting boundary conditions
- expected result: ?

var9: no thermostat
- expected result: ?

var10: thermostat v1
- expected result: ?

var11: thermostat v3
- expected result: ?
